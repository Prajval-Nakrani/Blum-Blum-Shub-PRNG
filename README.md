# Blum Blum Shub PRNG

Here we present a theoretical analysis of the Blum Blum Shub algorithm for generating random numbers, as proposed in "A SIMPLE UNPREDICTABLE PSEUDO-RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR" by _L. Blum, M. Blum and M. Shub_

We then experimentally test the robustness of the PRNG via a small simulation of the algorithm using common metrics like entropy and auto-correlation of the generated sequence.
